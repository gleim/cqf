    "\n",
    "VaR backtesting is used to assess how well a VaR model predicts actual losses. It involves comparing the predicted VaR values to the realized portfolio returns to identify instances where losses exceed the expected threshold, known as VaR breaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quantmod risk module provides a convenient framework for performing VaR backtests. It counts the number of breaches and evaluates whether they are statistically consistent with the model’s confidence level. This helps determine whether the VaR model underestimates or overestimates risk, making it a critical component of risk model validation and compliance."
